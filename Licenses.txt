    Software License Agreement

    PLEASE REVIEW THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS PRIOR TO USING THE
    ERICSSON TEXTURE COMPRESSION CODEC SOFTWARE (THE "SOFTWARE"). THE USE
    OF THE SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE
    FOLLOWING SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT (THE "SLA"). IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT
    SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS YOU MAY NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.

    Subject to the terms and conditions of the SLA, the licensee of the
    Software (the "Licensee") hereby, receives a non-exclusive,
    non-transferable, limited, free-of-charge, perpetual and worldwide
    license, to copy, use, distribute and modify the Software, but only
    for the purpose of developing, manufacturing, selling, using and
    distributing products including the Software in binary form, which
    products are used for compression and/or decompression according to
    the Khronos standard specifications OpenGL, OpenGL ES and
    WebGL. Notwithstanding anything of the above, Licensee may distribute
    [etcdec.cxx] in source code form provided (i) it is in unmodified
    form; and (ii) it is included in software owned by Licensee.

    If Licensee institutes, or threatens to institute, patent litigation
    against Ericsson or Ericsson's affiliates for using the Software for
    developing, having developed, manufacturing, having manufactured,
    selling, offer for sale, importing, using, leasing, operating,
    repairing and/or distributing products (i) within the scope of the
    Khronos framework; or (ii) using software or other intellectual
    property rights owned by Ericsson or its affiliates and provided under
    the Khronos framework, Ericsson shall have the right to terminate this
    SLA with immediate effect. Moreover, if Licensee institutes, or
    threatens to institute, patent litigation against any other licensee
    of the Software for using the Software in products within the scope of
    the Khronos framework, Ericsson shall have the right to terminate this
    SLA with immediate effect. However, should Licensee institute, or
    threaten to institute, patent litigation against any other licensee of
    the Software based on such other licensee's use of any other software
    together with the Software, then Ericsson shall have no right to
    terminate this SLA.

    This SLA does not transfer to Licensee any ownership to any Ericsson
    or third party intellectual property rights. All rights not expressly
    granted by Ericsson under this SLA are hereby expressly
    reserved. Furthermore, nothing in this SLA shall be construed as a
    right to use or sell products in a manner which conveys or purports to
    convey whether explicitly, by principles of implied license, or
    otherwise, any rights to any third party, under any patent of Ericsson
    or of Ericsson's affiliates covering or relating to any combination of
    the Software with any other software or product (not licensed
    hereunder) where the right applies specifically to the combination and
    not to the software or product itself.

    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS". ERICSSON MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OF
    ANY KIND, EXTENDS NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
    EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY; INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, EXPRESS,
    IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
    MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, SUITABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
    OF THE SOFTWARE IS WITH THE LICENSEE. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE
    DEFECTIVE, THE LICENSEE ASSUMES THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION. ERICSSON MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE MANUFACTURE,
    SALE, OFFERING FOR SALE, DISTRIBUTION, LEASE, USE OR IMPORTATION UNDER
    THE SLA WILL BE FREE FROM INFRINGEMENT OF PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS OR OTHER
    INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS, AND THE VALIDITY OF THE
    LICENSE AND THE SLA ARE SUBJECT TO LICENSEE'S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO
    MAKE SUCH DETERMINATION AND ACQUIRE SUCH LICENSES AS MAY BE NECESSARY
    WITH RESPECT TO PATENTS, COPYRIGHT AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF
    THIRD PARTIES.

    THE LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND ACCEPTS THAT THE SOFTWARE (I) IS NOT
    LICENSED FOR; (II) IS NOT DESIGNED FOR OR INTENDED FOR; AND (III) MAY
    NOT BE USED FOR; ANY MISSION CRITICAL APPLICATIONS SUCH AS, BUT NOT
    LIMITED TO OPERATION OF NUCLEAR OR HEALTHCARE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND/OR
    NETWORKS, AIRCRAFT OR TRAIN CONTROL AND/OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS OR
    ANY OTHER COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND/OR NETWORKS OR CONTROL AND/OR
    COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS ALL IN WHICH CASE THE FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE
    COULD LEAD TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL, MATERIAL OR
    ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. LICENSEE'S RIGHTS UNDER THIS LICENSE WILL
    TERMINATE AUTOMATICALLY AND IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT NOTICE IF LICENSEE
    FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THIS PARAGRAPH.

    IN NO EVENT SHALL ERICSSON BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER,
    INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PERSONAL INJURY, ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
    INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN
    CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERUPTIONS, OR ANY
    OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY THE LICENSEE OR THIRD
    PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
    SOFTWARE) REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR
    OTHERWISE), EVEN IF THE LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED
    OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    Licensee acknowledges that "ERICSSON ///" is the corporate trademark
    of Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson and that both "Ericsson" and the
    figure "///" are important features of the trade names of
    Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson. Nothing contained in these terms and
    conditions shall be deemed to grant Licensee any right, title or
    interest in the word "Ericsson" or the figure "///". No delay or
    omission by Ericsson to exercise any right or power shall impair any
    such right or power to be construed to be a waiver thereof. Consent by
    Ericsson to, or waiver of, a breach by the Licensee shall not
    constitute consent to, waiver of, or excuse for any other different or
    subsequent breach.

    This SLA shall be governed by the substantive law of Sweden. Any
    dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with
    this SLA, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be
    submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Swedish Courts.

  no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
  Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
  the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,

  transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
  licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s)
  alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
  Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against
  any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
  that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You
  under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation
  is filed.

  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
  Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and
  in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy
  of this License; and

  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
  You changed the files; and

  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
  all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source

  of the Derivative Works; and

  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
  then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy
  of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
  notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
  one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part
  of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
  along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
  Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
  License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works
  that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
  Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
  as modifying the License.

  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
  additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
  or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as
  a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise
  complies with the conditions stated in this License.

  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
  Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
  Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without
  any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein

  A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness
  of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
  exercise of permissions under this License.

  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether
  in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
  applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to
  in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including
  any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
  character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
  to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
  damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility
  of such damages.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work
  or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
  acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
  and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations,
  You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on
  behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend,
  and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
  asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty
  or additional liability. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
